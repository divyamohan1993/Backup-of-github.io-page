Instead, they know what will happen based on earlier experience. \n 12345678912 Jakob Nielsen","Most [clients] expect experience design to be a discrete activity, solving all their problems with a single functional specification or a single research study. It must be an ongoing effort, a process of continually learning about users, responding to their behaviors, and evolving the product or service. \n 12345678912 Dan Brown","Typography is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters.\n 12345678912 Steve Byers","The worst thing you can do to anybody trying to be creative is to demand participation in their vision. \n 12345678912 Chuck Klosterman","No matter how cool your interface is, it would be better if there were less of it.\n 12345678912 Alan Cooper","Those who say &#8220;it&#8217;s not personal, it&#8217;s just business&#8221; are lying.

Mastery occurs with the realization of these rules. Innovation occurs at the point of intelligent and creative rebellion against them. \n 12345678912 Fiel Valdez","I recently saw another demonstration of graphic design&#8217;s ubiquity. Someone had taken a series of photographs of busy streets and then painstakingly removed all the logos, symbols, signs, colours, street names and road markings. In other words, they had removed all the graphic design from these photographs. The results were staggering. A world without graphic design is an unrecognizable world — more alien than all but the most extreme sci-fi imaginings.\n 12345678912 Adrian Shaughnessy","Here&#8217;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They&#8217;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them.  About the only thing you can&#8217;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward. Maybe they have to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?  While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\n 12345678912 Apple Commercial","It is easier to talk than to listen.

A lot of big sites don’t do that, and it’s a problem. Twitter started as a beautifully simple product, but it’s now going the same route as Facebook.

Some guy does a parallax scrolling site, and now your boss wants you to add that to your corporate PR website for some reason. Glossy buttons, Gaussian Noise, linen texture, new things that look fake-old, then back to minimalism and flat colors as a reaction to the glossy noisy textured fake-old stuff.\n 12345678912 Jonas Downey","One of the most significant differences between graphic designers and other visual artists is our unhinged love of typography.\n 12345678912 Greg Breeding","A logo doesn&#8217;t sell, it identifies. A logo derives its meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes, not the other way around. A logo is less important than the product it signifies; what it means is more important than what it looks like. \n 12345678912 Paul Rand","Observation and imitation are so often the steps to creative maturation.

Even if the only user testing you ever do is asking some friends to use a site while you observe them, you&#8217;ll already be better for it. \n 12345678912 Collis Ta&#8217;eed","The way to &#8220;get your name out there&#8221; is to establish a pattern of excellent work and a reputation for integrity over several years. \n 12345678912 Andy Rutledge","Decoration is just make-up for the wrinkles of the idea. \n 12345678912 Thomas Manss","The best ideas come as jokes.

Today, entire generations are growing up watching MTV and playing video games and it is safe to assume that these people have a high degree of visual sophistication. and are not easily discouraged by a lens straightforward or ambiguous typography. On the contrary, they are attracted and enticed to read something because of visual richness. \n 12345678912 Ruby Vanderlans","Be a first rate version of yourself, not a second rate version of someone else. \n 12345678912 Judy Garland","Good design is partially creativity and innovation, but primarily knowledge and awareness. \n 12345678912 Chuck Green","Never show fools unfinished work. \n 12345678912 Michael Schrage","Teaching peers is one of the best ways to develop mastery. \n 12345678912 Jeff Atwood","Whoever tells the best story wins.\n 12345678912 Annette Simmons","Inspiration is perishable. \n 12345678912 37 Signals","If the users can&#8217;t find it, the function&#8217;s not there. \n 12345678912 Human Factors International","Artists are natural marketers for everyone but themselves. \n 12345678912 Oren Sherman","When Einstein realized, &#8220;Dear me, this universe with its wonders all adds up to E=mc2?,&#8221; he did not stop to think whether this concept would sell better set in Futura or Antikva. \n 12345678912 Kari Piippo","Inspired interiors indubitably involve ingenious imitations of inspired interiors.\n 12345678912 Ana Cummings","Thirty spokes meet in the hub,\nbut the empty space between them\nis the essence of the wheel.\nPots are formed from clay,\nbut the empty space within it\nis the essence of the pot.\nWalls with windows and doors\nform the house,\nbut the empty space within it\nis the essence of the home.\n 12345678912 Lao Tse","Begin with the end in mind. \n 12345678912 Lana Rigsby","When I design, I don&#8217;t consider the technical or commercial parameters so much as the desire for a dream that humans have attempted to project onto an object. \n 12345678912 Philippe Starck","Do what you love and tomorrow will pay the rent. \n 12345678912 Felix Sockwell","Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. \n 12345678912 Antoine de Saint Exup&#233;ry","Business owners need to realize that their design is a reflection of their business even if it is not intentional.
